This function is for non-Hermitian case, in which the entries of matrix are complex scalars.\n\nIn this function, the parameters diag_l and diag_u determine the range ([diag_l, diag_u]) of lower triangular part to be filled. The two parameters should also be negatif, which refer to the offfsets of diagonals in the lower triangular part. The parameter size defines the size of matrix to be generated.\n\nThe non-zero elements of the initialized matrices are randomly generated in the interval (0,1). Two optionals parameters shift and scale allow shifting and scaling this interval.\n\nAnother optional parameter sparsity is more important. It determines the possility of the elements within the band of diagonal determined by diag_l and diag_u to be non-zeros. In other words, the initalized matrix would be more sparse with a smaller number of sparisty parameter.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> Am=spzeros(ComplexF64, 50, 50);\njulia> initMat!(Am, -20, -10, 50)\njulia> Am\n50×50 SparseMatrixCSC{ComplexF64, Int64} with 335 stored entries:\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⣟⡳⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⣿⣿⣢⣵⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠙⢟⣾⣿⣽⢲⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠙⢽⣿⣛⣿⣵⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠽⣻⡾⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢟⣻⢿⢻⣗⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣽⣯⣻⣳⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣛⢿⡾⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢯⡽⣯⣜⣷⢄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠚⠋⠛⠚⠓⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\nExamples\n\njulia> Am=spzeros(ComplexF64, 50, 50);\njulia> initMat!(Am, -20, -10, 50, sparsity=0.1)\njulia> Am\n50×50 SparseMatrixCSC{ComplexF64, Int64} with 36 stored entries:\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠠⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠉⠂⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠂⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢂⠀⠈⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠂⠈⠀⠤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⢀⠅⠂⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠂⠀⠠⠈⠰⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠂⠈⠀⠡⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠄⢄⡆⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"custorm/#Non-Symmetric-Case","page":"Customization","title":"Non-Symmetric Case","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"custorm/","page":"Customization","title":"Customization","text":"initMat!(matrix::SparseMatrixCSC{Tv, Ti}, diag_l::Ti, diag_u::Ti, size::Ti; scale::Real = 1.0, shift::Real = 0.0, sparsity::Real = 0.9) where {Tv<:Real, Ti<:Integer}","category":"page"},{"location":"custorm/#SMG2S.initMat!-Union{Tuple{Ti}, Tuple{Tv}, Tuple{SparseMatrixCSC{Tv, Ti}, Ti, Ti, Ti}} where {Tv<:Real, Ti<:Integer}","page":"Customization","title":"SMG2S.initMat!","text":"initMat!(matrix::SparseMatrixCSC{Tv, Ti}, diag_l::Ti, diag_u::Ti, size::Ti; scale::Real = 1.0, shift::Real = 0.0, sparsity::Real = 0.9) where {Tv<:Real, Ti<:Integer}\n\nInitialization of matrix to be generated.
